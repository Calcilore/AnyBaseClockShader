# Number Renderer Clock Shader
this is a shader that renders the current time, and it supports any base up to base 10 (this is because i haven't made code to render characters past base 10)

this shader is compatible with shadertoy and you can download the qsb file from releases to use this with kde plasma's shader wallpaper plugin
